# Electron Build Guide 2019

It is 2019 and Currently Electron has been around for almost 8 years. Unfortunately some of the documentation and tutorials on how to Build, Pack, And handling CI & CD are either lacking or severely out of date.

This tutorial aims to create and outline the process not only to setup the application and get users started but to setup some of the best features that are available but poorly documented.
